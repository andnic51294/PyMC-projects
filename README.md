### Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation.ipynb
*In the LDA model, each document is viewed as a mixture of topics that are present in the corpus. The model proposes that each word in the document is attributable to one of the documentâ€™s topics.
*The idea behind LDA is to model documents as arising from multiple topics, where a topic is defined to be a distribution over a fixed vocabulary of terms.
*Given a dataset of documents, LDA backtracks and tries to figure out what topics would create those documents in the first place.
